<h2>OUR CHILDREN & STUDENTS</h2>
<p>We have great environments available for your kids where they can learn about God and build relationships with others their age.</p>
<p><b>Sprouts</b> 1is for babies (6 weeks) to preschoolers (4 years old) and is available during all Sunday morning services. Security is important and all workers have been background checked prior to working with your children. They will be well cared for while learning about God's love for them.</p>

<p><b>Kidslife</b> is for children Kindergarten - 5th grade.  Every Sunday our kids at RealLife Church have a blast learning about God in an environment created just for them. They will learn Bible stories and principles from God's Word through worship, teaching, videos and games.</p>

<p><b>Echo</b> is our ministry for Middle and High School students. We believe that students are not only the church of the future... they are the church of today! God desires to use them to impact their schools, family and friends for His Kingdom.  Echo is all about resounding God's love to a lost world. We strive to empower our students to not only live for God but to also help others live for Him. </p>
